      <description>People are really good at comparing numbers. If you have 1,000 apples and I have 10, you can tell me pretty quickly that you have 990 more apples than I do. You can also put that into some context - we know intuitively that that’s a lot of apples - so it’s helpful as well.
Percentages are numbers as well, so they should be easy to measure as well.</description>
