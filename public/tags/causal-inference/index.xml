      <description>One of the most interesting questions we can ask is “does x cause y?”. If we know what causes something, we can avoid it (we know that fire ignites gas, so we don’t light a candle in a room filled with propane) or pursue it (we know that diet and exercise lead to better health outcomes, so we grudgingly go with it). You may never run a test like this yourself, but since they’re so prevalent it’s helpful to understand how they work and what makes a test good.</description>
