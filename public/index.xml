      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a data analyst looking to explain data in a way that hopefully makes sense to non-data people, as well as occasionally provide more detailed tutorials and guides on a variety of subjects related to data such as software (R and Tableau), techniques, and general thinking about problems and questions.</description>

      <description>People are really good at comparing numbers. If you have 1,000 apples and I have 10, you can tell me pretty quickly that you have 990 more apples than I do. You can also put that into some context - we know intuitively that that’s a lot of apples - so it’s helpful as well.
Percentages are numbers as well, so they should be easy to measure as well.</description>
